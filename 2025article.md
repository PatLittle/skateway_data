 * During last season (2024) we setup this project to track the ice conditions of the Rideau Canal a few times a day, and to explore using the python library [ESRI_DUMP](https://pypi.org/project/esridump/) to dump an ESRI WFS to a GeoJSON file, then flatten that into a CSV.
 * This allows non-GEO Data folks to use simple data flat data techniques to work with Geo Data from ESRI Rest endpoints

 * 2024 was a limited schedule for skating, but we should be able to turn the GH Action back on and keep adding to the dataset form this season.

 * Here is an Google Collab notenook with an example to get started with: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/gist/PatLittle/413eef25fae1d1a2e1d5be7ee38c79d0/dump-canal-esri.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
